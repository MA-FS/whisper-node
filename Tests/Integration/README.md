- ✅ Transcription accuracy and performance
- ✅ Text insertion in various target applications
- ✅ Error handling across all components

### Performance Requirements
- ✅ End-to-end latency under 3 seconds
- ✅ Hotkey to audio start latency under 100ms
- ✅ Memory usage under 100MB during normal operation
- ✅ No memory leaks detected over extended usage

### Compatibility Requirements
- ✅ Works on macOS 10.15+ (Catalina and later)
- ✅ Compatible with both Intel and Apple Silicon hardware
- ✅ Works with various audio device configurations
- ✅ Compatible with common target applications

### Reliability Requirements

- ✅ Stable operation under stress conditions
- ✅ Consistent behavior across different system configurations

## Running Tests

### Prerequisites
- macOS 13+ (Ventura)
- Accessibility permissions granted to test runner
- Target applications installed for compatibility testing

### Command Line
```bash
# Run all integration tests
swift test --filter IntegrationTestSuite

# Run workflow tests
swift test --filter WorkflowTests

# Run component interaction tests
swift test --filter ComponentInteractionTests

# Run performance tests
swift test --filter IntegrationPerformanceTests

# Generate compatibility report
swift test --filter testAllApplicationsComprehensiveCompatibility
```

### Test Environment Setup
1. Grant accessibility permissions to Terminal (for automated tests)
   - System Preferences > Security & Privacy > Privacy > Accessibility
   - Add Terminal.app and grant permissions

2. Install target applications for compatibility testing:
   - VS Code
   - Safari (built-in)
   - Slack
   - TextEdit (built-in)
   - Mail (built-in)
   - Terminal (built-in)

## Test Scenarios

### Basic User Workflows
- Basic dictation workflow
- Rapid successive dictations
- Long-form dictation workflow

### Real-World Scenarios
- Email composition scenario
- Code documentation scenario
- Meeting notes scenario

### Edge Cases
- Interrupted workflow recovery
- Silent audio handling
- Very short utterance workflow
- Performance under system load

### Error Recovery
- Audio engine failure recovery
- Transcription engine failure recovery
- Text insertion failure recovery

## Performance Validation

The framework validates all performance requirements:

- **Total Latency**: < 3 seconds for typical usage
- **Hotkey Response**: < 100ms from press to audio start
- **Memory Usage**: < 100MB during normal operation
- **CPU Usage**: < 150% during transcription
- **Success Rate**: > 95% for normal usage scenarios

## Integration with CI/CD

The integration tests are designed to run in CI/CD environments:

### GitHub Actions Example
```yaml
name: Integration Tests
on: [push, pull_request]
jobs:
  integration-tests:
    runs-on: macos-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - name: Run Integration Tests
        run: |
          swift test --filter SystemIntegrationTests
          swift test --filter IntegrationPerformanceTests
        env:
          CI: true
          INTEGRATION_TEST_MODE: true
```

### Jenkins Example
```groovy
pipeline {
    agent { label 'macos' }
    stages {
        stage('Integration Tests') {
            steps {
                sh '''
                    export CI=true
                    swift test --filter IntegrationTestSuite
                '''
            }
        }
    }
}
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Accessibility Permissions**: Tests require accessibility permissions to simulate user interactions
2. **Audio Devices**: Some tests require audio input devices to be available
3. **Target Applications**: Application-specific tests require the target applications to be installed

### Test Failures

- Check system configuration compatibility
- Verify accessibility permissions
- Ensure target applications are installed and accessible
- Review performance metrics for resource constraints

## Contributing

When adding new integration tests:

1. Follow the existing test structure and naming conventions
2. Use the TestHarness for consistent test setup
3. Include performance measurements where appropriate
4. Add comprehensive error handling tests
5. Update this README with new test scenarios
