# Task 16: Performance Monitoring & Optimization

**Status**: ⏳ WIP  
**Priority**: Medium  
**Estimated Hours**: 6  
**Dependencies**: T06  

## Description

Implement CPU/memory monitoring with automatic performance adjustments.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] CPU usage monitoring during transcription
- [ ] Memory usage tracking (idle/peak)
- [ ] Automatic model downgrade at >80% CPU
- [ ] Performance metrics logging
- [ ] Battery impact optimization
- [ ] Thermal throttling awareness

## Implementation Details

### Performance Monitoring
```swift
class PerformanceMonitor {
    private var cpuUsage: Double = 0
    private var memoryUsage: UInt64 = 0
    private var isThrottling = false
    
    func monitorPerformance() {
        // Track CPU and memory usage
        // Implement automatic adjustments
    }
}
```

### Automatic Adjustments
- Model downgrade when CPU >80%
- Reduced inference frequency under thermal pressure
- Battery-aware optimizations

### Metrics Collection
- CPU usage during transcription
- Memory allocation patterns
- Model loading/unloading timing
- Battery impact measurements

## Testing Plan

- [ ] Performance monitoring is accurate
- [ ] Automatic adjustments work properly
- [ ] Battery impact is minimized
- [ ] Thermal management prevents overheating
