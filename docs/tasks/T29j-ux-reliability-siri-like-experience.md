    private var currentStepIndex = 0
    
    func proceedToNextStep() {
        currentStepIndex += 1
        updateUI()
        
        if currentStepIndex >= onboardingSteps.count {
            completeOnboarding()
        }
    }
    
    private func updateUI() {
        let step = onboardingSteps[currentStepIndex]
        let progress = Double(currentStepIndex) / Double(onboardingSteps.count)
        
        // Smooth progress animation
        NSAnimationContext.runAnimationGroup { context in
            context.duration = 0.3
            progressIndicator.animator().doubleValue = progress * 100
        }
        
        // Update status with helpful information
        statusLabel.stringValue = step.description

    func startMonitoring() {
        monitoringTimer = Timer.scheduledTimer(withTimeInterval: 5.0, repeats: true) { _ in
            self.updatePerformanceMetrics()
            self.optimizeIfNeeded()
        }
    }
    
    private func updatePerformanceMetrics() {
        cpuUsage = getCurrentCPUUsage()
        memoryUsage = getCurrentMemoryUsage()
    }
    
    private func optimizeIfNeeded() {
        guard isOptimizationEnabled else { return }
        
        // Auto-optimize based on system conditions
        if cpuUsage > 80 {
            // Reduce processing frequency or quality
            WhisperNodeCore.shared.enablePerformanceMode()
        } else if cpuUsage < 20 {
            // Restore full quality
            WhisperNodeCore.shared.disablePerformanceMode()
        }
        
        if memoryUsage > 500 { // MB
            // Free unused resources
            WhisperNodeCore.shared.freeUnusedResources()
        }
    }
    
    private func getCurrentCPUUsage() -> Double {
        var info = mach_task_basic_info()
        var count = mach_msg_type_number_t(MemoryLayout<mach_task_basic_info>.size)/4
        
        let kerr: kern_return_t = withUnsafeMutablePointer(to: &info) {
            $0.withMemoryRebound(to: integer_t.self, capacity: 1) {
                task_info(mach_task_self_,
                         task_flavor_t(MACH_TASK_BASIC_INFO),
                         $0,
                         &count)
            }
        }
        
        if kerr == KERN_SUCCESS {
            return Double(info.resident_size) / 1024 / 1024 // Convert to MB
        }
        
        return 0
    }
}
