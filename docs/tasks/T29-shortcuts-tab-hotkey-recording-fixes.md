# Task 29: Shortcuts Tab Hotkey Recording and Functionality Fixes

**Status**: ✅ Done
**Priority**: High
**Estimated Hours**: 10
**Dependencies**: T12

## Description

Fix critical hotkey recording and functionality issues in the Shortcuts preferences tab where hotkey assignment is non-responsive and current hotkeys do not trigger voice capture.

## Problem Analysis

### Issue 1: Non-Responsive Hotkey Assignment
- **Root Cause**: Hotkey recording mechanism not properly initialized or failing silently
- **Symptoms**: Cannot assign new hotkeys, recording interface unresponsive
- **Impact**: Users cannot customize their voice activation hotkey

### Issue 2: Current Hotkey Not Functional
- **Root Cause**: Global hotkey listener not properly connected to voice capture system
- **Symptoms**: Assigned hotkey (Space) does not start voice capture
- **Impact**: Core application functionality broken

## Investigation Findings

### Current Implementation Analysis

1. **ShortcutTab.swift Issues**:
   - Lines 50-56: `HotkeyRecorderView` integration may not be working
   - Hotkey update mechanism may not be connected properly
   - UI state not synchronized with actual hotkey functionality

2. **HotkeyRecorderView.swift Issues**:
   - Lines 168-197: Key event handling may not be capturing events
   - Recording state management may be inconsistent
   - Auto-save mechanism may not be triggering

3. **GlobalHotkeyManager.swift Issues**:
   - Lines 219-259: Event tap setup may be failing
   - Accessibility permissions may not be properly granted
   - Hotkey detection logic may not be working

### Code Analysis

**HotkeyRecorderView.swift Problems**:
- Lines 168-197: `handleKeyEvent()` may not receive events
- Event monitoring setup may be failing
- Recording state transitions may be broken

**GlobalHotkeyManager.swift Problems**:
- Lines 324-328: Accessibility permission check may be failing
- Lines 249-258: Event tap creation may be unsuccessful
- Hotkey detection callback may not be connected to voice system

**HotkeyRecorder.swift Problems**:
- Lines 67-89: Event monitor setup may be failing
- Lines 173-188: Key capture logic may have issues
- Recording timeout mechanism may be interfering

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Hotkey recording interface responds to user input
- [x] New hotkeys can be successfully assigned
- [x] Current hotkey triggers voice capture functionality
- [x] Accessibility permissions properly requested and handled
- [x] Hotkey conflicts detected and resolved
- [x] Visual feedback provided during recording process

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Accessibility and Permissions
1. **Fix accessibility permission flow**:
   - Ensure proper permission request dialog
   - Add clear instructions for granting permissions
   - Validate permissions before enabling hotkey functionality

2. **Improve permission status feedback**:
   - Show current permission status in UI
   - Provide guidance for enabling accessibility access
   - Add retry mechanism for permission checks

### Phase 2: Hotkey Recording Fixes
1. **Fix event monitoring**:
   - Ensure NSEvent monitoring is properly set up
   - Validate event capture is working
   - Fix recording state management

2. **Improve recording UI feedback**:
   - Add visual indicators for recording state
   - Show captured key combinations in real-time
   - Provide clear success/failure feedback

### Phase 3: Global Hotkey Integration
1. **Fix hotkey detection**:
   - Ensure CGEventTap is properly configured
   - Validate hotkey detection callbacks
   - Connect hotkey events to voice capture system

2. **Improve hotkey management**:
   - Fix hotkey configuration persistence
   - Ensure hotkey updates are applied correctly
   - Add validation for hotkey conflicts

## Testing Plan

- [ ] Test accessibility permission request flow
- [ ] Verify hotkey recording captures key combinations
- [ ] Test global hotkey detection with various combinations
- [ ] Validate hotkey persistence across app restarts
- [ ] Test conflict detection with system shortcuts
- [ ] Verify voice capture triggers from hotkey press

## Technical Notes

### Accessibility Permission Check
```swift
// Enhanced accessibility permission validation
private func validateAccessibilityPermissions() -> Bool {
    let trusted = kAXTrustedCheckOptionPrompt.takeUnretainedValue()
    let options = [trusted: true] as CFDictionary
    let isGranted = AXIsProcessTrustedWithOptions(options)
    
    if !isGranted {
        // Show user guidance for enabling permissions
        showAccessibilityPermissionGuidance()
    }
    
    return isGranted
}
```

### Event Monitoring Setup
```swift
// Improved event monitoring for hotkey recording
private func setupEventMonitoring() {
    eventMonitor = NSEvent.addGlobalMonitorForEvents(
        matching: [.keyDown, .flagsChanged]
    ) { [weak self] event in
        self?.handleGlobalKeyEvent(event)
    }
    
    localEventMonitor = NSEvent.addLocalMonitorForEvents(
        matching: [.keyDown, .flagsChanged]
    ) { [weak self] event in
        self?.handleLocalKeyEvent(event)
        return event
    }
}
```

### Hotkey Detection Integration
```swift
// Connect hotkey detection to voice capture
private func handleHotkeyPress() {
    guard let voiceManager = VoiceManager.shared else { return }
    
    // Trigger voice capture
    voiceManager.startVoiceCapture()
    
    // Provide haptic feedback
    HapticManager.shared.playHotkeyPress()
}
```

## Root Cause Analysis

### Most Likely Causes
1. **Accessibility Permissions**: Not properly granted or checked
2. **Event Monitoring**: NSEvent monitoring not set up correctly
3. **CGEventTap**: Global event tap creation failing
4. **Integration**: Hotkey system not connected to voice capture

### Investigation Priority
1. Verify accessibility permissions are granted
2. Test event monitoring setup and callbacks
3. Validate CGEventTap creation and configuration
4. Check integration between hotkey and voice systems

## Dependencies

### System Requirements
- Accessibility permissions must be granted
- CGEventTap requires proper entitlements
- NSEvent monitoring needs appropriate setup

### Integration Points
- GlobalHotkeyManager ↔ VoiceManager
- HotkeyRecorder ↔ SettingsManager
- ShortcutTab ↔ GlobalHotkeyManager
