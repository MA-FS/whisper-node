# Task 11: Preferences Window - Models Tab

**Status**: âœ… Done  
**Priority**: High  
**Estimated Hours**: 14  
**Dependencies**: T06, T09  

## Description

Build Models tab for downloading, managing, and switching between Whisper models.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Model list with sizes and descriptions
- [x] Download progress indicators
- [x] Storage usage display
- [x] Model deletion with confirmation
- [x] Automatic fallback to smaller models
- [x] Checksum verification for downloads
- [x] Low disk space warnings (<1GB)

## Implementation Details

### Model Management UI
```swift
struct ModelsTab: View {
    @State private var models = [
        ModelInfo(name: "tiny.en", size: "39MB", status: .bundled),
        ModelInfo(name: "small.en", size: "244MB", status: .available),
        ModelInfo(name: "medium.en", size: "769MB", status: .available)
    ]
}
```

### Download System
- Atomic downloads with progress tracking
- SHA256 checksum verification
- Automatic retry with exponential backoff
- Background download support

### Storage Management
- Display storage usage per model
- Cleanup of incomplete downloads
- Disk space monitoring

## Testing Plan

- [x] Model downloads complete successfully
- [x] Progress indicators work correctly
- [x] Checksums prevent corrupted downloads
- [x] Storage calculations are accurate

## Implementation Notes

### Completed Components
- **ModelsTab.swift**: Main UI component with model selection and download interface
- **ModelManager.swift**: Core service handling model lifecycle, downloads, and storage
- **ModelInfo struct**: Data model for model metadata and status tracking
- **ModelRowView**: Reusable component for individual model display
- **Extended SettingsManager**: Added model preferences (activeModelName, autoDownloadUpdates)
- **Comprehensive tests**: ModelsTabTests.swift with 15+ test cases

### Key Features Implemented
- Real-time download progress with cancel/retry functionality
- SHA256 checksum verification for download integrity  
- Disk space monitoring with warnings when <1GB available
- Atomic download operations preventing corrupted files
- Model deletion with confirmation dialogs
- Automatic fallback to bundled tiny.en when active model deleted
- Integration with existing preferences design patterns

### Models Configuration
- **tiny.en**: 39MB, bundled with app (default)
- **small.en**: 244MB, downloadable from Hugging Face
- **medium.en**: 769MB, downloadable from Hugging Face

### Security & Privacy
- 100% offline operation after initial download
- No telemetry or usage tracking
- Secure checksum verification prevents corrupted models
- Safe file operations with proper error handling
