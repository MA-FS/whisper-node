# Task 22: CI/CD Pipeline Setup

**Status**: âœ… Done  
**Priority**: Medium  
**Estimated Hours**: 12  
**Dependencies**: T20, T21  

## Description

Configure GitHub Actions for automated building, testing, and notarization.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] GitHub Actions workflow configuration
- [x] Automated build and test pipeline
- [x] Code signing in CI environment
- [x] Notarization automation
- [x] Release artifact generation
- [x] Version tagging and changelog

## Implementation Details

### GitHub Actions Workflow
```yaml
name: Build and Release
on:
  push:
    tags: ['v*']
  
jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: macos-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - name: Setup Xcode
        uses: maxim-lobanov/setup-xcode@v1
      - name: Build App
        run: xcodebuild -scheme WhisperNode
```

### Code Signing in CI
- Import Developer ID certificates
- Configure provisioning profiles
- Secure secrets management
- Keychain setup and cleanup

### Notarization
- Submit to Apple for notarization
- Wait for approval
- Staple notarization ticket
- Verify notarization success

### Artifact Management
- Upload signed DMG as release asset
- Generate release notes
- Tag management and versioning

## Testing Plan

- [x] CI builds complete successfully
- [x] Code signing works in automation
- [x] Notarization completes without errors
- [x] Release artifacts are generated correctly

## Implementation Summary

Created comprehensive CI/CD pipeline with three GitHub Actions workflows:

### 1. `ci.yml` - Continuous Integration
- Runs on push/PR to main/develop branches
- Lint checks, multi-configuration builds, integration tests
- Dependency auditing and vulnerability scanning

### 2. `build-and-release.yml` - Release Automation
- Triggered by version tags (v*)
- Full test suite, signed builds, notarization
- Automatic DMG creation and GitHub release

### 3. `security.yml` - Security & Compliance
- Secret scanning, privacy audits, compliance checks
- Runs on main pushes, PRs, and weekly schedule

### Key Features
- Apple Silicon optimized builds
- Automated code signing and notarization
- Comprehensive security scanning
- Dependency caching for performance
- Detailed documentation and troubleshooting guides

### Required Secrets Setup
- Code signing certificates (P12 format)
- Apple notarization credentials
- Team ID and app-specific passwords

The pipeline integrates seamlessly with existing build scripts and maintains the project's privacy-first, offline-only architecture.
