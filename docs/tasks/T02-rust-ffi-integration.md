# Task 02: Rust FFI Integration Setup

**Status**: âœ… Done  
**Priority**: High  
**Estimated Hours**: 12  
**Dependencies**: T01  

## Description

Configure Rust workspace for whisper.cpp bindings with Apple Silicon optimizations and FFI bridge to Swift.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Rust workspace configured with whisper.cpp
- [x] Apple Silicon optimizations enabled (-mfpu=neon + -march=armv8.2-a)
- [x] FFI bridge working between Swift and Rust
- [x] Build system integration complete

## Implementation Details

### Rust Workspace Setup
- Create `whisper-rust/` directory
- Configure `Cargo.toml` with whisper.cpp dependencies
- Set up build.rs for C++ compilation

### Apple Silicon Optimizations
```toml
[target.'cfg(target_arch = "aarch64")']
rustflags = ["-C", "target-feature=+neon", "-C", "target-cpu=apple-m1"]
```

### FFI Bridge
- Define C-compatible interface
- Create Swift bridging header
- Implement memory-safe data transfer

### Build Integration
- Integrate Rust build with Xcode
- Configure linking and library paths
- Set up debug/release configurations

## Testing Plan

- [x] Rust library compiles successfully
- [x] Swift can call Rust functions (placeholder implementation)
- [x] Memory management works correctly
- [ ] Performance meets requirements (pending full whisper integration)

## Implementation Notes

- Rust workspace successfully configured with whisper-rs 0.14
- FFI bridge created with C-compatible interface
- Swift Package Manager integration complete with separate WhisperBridge target
- Apple Silicon optimizations configured in .cargo/config.toml
- Build script created for automation
- Placeholder implementation allows Swift compilation while whisper API integration is refined

## Next Steps

- Resolve whisper-rs API changes for full transcription functionality
- Performance testing with actual audio data
- Integration with audio capture pipeline (T04)
