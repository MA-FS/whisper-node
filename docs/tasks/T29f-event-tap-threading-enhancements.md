# Event Tap Threading Enhancements

**Date**: December 18, 2024
**Status**: âœ… COMPLETE
**Priority**: MEDIUM
**Completed**: January 19, 2025

## Overview

Move the CGEventTap listening to a dedicated background thread to isolate key capture from the main UI thread, improving reliability and responsiveness under high system load.

## Issues Addressed

### 1. **Main Thread Blocking**
- **Problem**: CGEventTap currently runs on main thread's run loop, potentially causing delays
- **Root Cause**: Main thread busy with UI rendering or other tasks can delay keyboard event processing
- **Impact**: Hotkey detection becomes unreliable under high system load

### 2. **UI Responsiveness**
- **Problem**: Event processing on main thread can affect UI responsiveness
- **Root Cause**: Event tap processing competing with UI updates for main thread time
- **Impact**: App feels sluggish during intensive event processing

### 3. **Event Processing Reliability**
- **Problem**: Critical hotkey events might be missed during main thread congestion
- **Root Cause**: Run loop source processing delayed when main thread is busy
- **Impact**: Inconsistent hotkey behavior, especially during heavy app usage

## Technical Requirements

### 1. Dedicated Event Thread
- Create background thread specifically for event tap processing
- Attach event tap's run loop source to background thread's run loop
- Ensure proper thread lifecycle management

### 2. Thread-Safe Communication
- Maintain main actor dispatch for UI-related delegate callbacks
- Implement thread-safe state management between event thread and main thread
- Ensure proper synchronization for shared resources

### 3. Performance Optimization
- Optimize event processing for minimal latency
- Reduce context switching overhead
- Maintain or improve current performance characteristics

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Threading Architecture Design
1. **Thread Management System**
   - Design dedicated event processing thread
   - Define thread lifecycle (start, stop, cleanup)
   - Plan thread communication mechanisms

2. **State Synchronization**
   - Identify shared state between threads
   - Design thread-safe access patterns
   - Plan synchronization primitives usage

### Phase 2: Implementation
1. **Event Thread Creation**
   - Implement background thread for event tap
   - Move run loop source attachment to background thread
   - Ensure proper thread naming and priority

2. **Callback Threading**
   - Maintain main thread dispatch for delegate callbacks
   - Implement efficient thread switching for UI updates
   - Preserve existing callback behavior

### Phase 3: Testing and Optimization
1. **Performance Testing**
   - Measure event processing latency
   - Test under various system load conditions
   - Validate UI responsiveness improvements

2. **Reliability Testing**

### Event Processing Thread
```swift
class EventProcessingThread {
    private var thread: Thread?
    private var runLoop: RunLoop?
    private var eventTap: CFMachPort?
    private let threadName = "WhisperNode.EventProcessing"
    
    func start(with eventTap: CFMachPort) {
        self.eventTap = eventTap
        
        thread = Thread { [weak self] in
            self?.runEventLoop()
        }
        thread?.name = threadName
        thread?.qualityOfService = .userInteractive
        thread?.start()
    }
    
    private func runEventLoop() {
        runLoop = RunLoop.current
        
        guard let eventTap = eventTap else { return }
        
        let runLoopSource = CFMachPortCreateRunLoopSource(kCFAllocatorDefault, eventTap, 0)
        CFRunLoopAddSource(runLoop?.getCFRunLoop(), runLoopSource, CFRunLoopMode.commonModes)
        
        // Keep the run loop alive
        while !Thread.current.isCancelled {
            runLoop?.run(mode: .default, before: Date(timeIntervalSinceNow: 0.1))
        }
        
        // Cleanup
        CFRunLoopRemoveSource(runLoop?.getCFRunLoop(), runLoopSource, CFRunLoopMode.commonModes)
    }
    
    func stop() {
        thread?.cancel()
        CFRunLoopStop(runLoop?.getCFRunLoop())
        thread = nil
        runLoop = nil
    }
}
```

### Thread-Safe State Management
```swift
class ThreadSafeHotkeyState {
    private let queue = DispatchQueue(label: "WhisperNode.HotkeyState", attributes: .concurrent)
    private var _isRecording = false
    private var _keyDownTime: Date?
    
    var isRecording: Bool {
        get {
            return queue.sync { _isRecording }
        }
        set {
            queue.async(flags: .barrier) { [weak self] in
                self?._isRecording = newValue
            }
        }
    }
    
    var keyDownTime: Date? {
        get {
            return queue.sync { _keyDownTime }
        }
        set {
            queue.async(flags: .barrier) { [weak self] in
                self?._keyDownTime = newValue
            }
        }
    }
}
```

### Enhanced GlobalHotkeyManager
```swift
class GlobalHotkeyManager {
    private var eventThread: EventProcessingThread?
    private let hotkeyState = ThreadSafeHotkeyState()
    
    func startListening() -> Bool {
        // Create event tap as before
        guard let eventTap = createEventTap() else { return false }
        
        // Start dedicated thread for event processing
        eventThread = EventProcessingThread()
        eventThread?.start(with: eventTap)
        
        return true
    }
    
    func stopListening() {
        eventThread?.stop()
        eventThread = nil
        
        if let eventTap = self.eventTap {
            CFMachPortInvalidate(eventTap)
            self.eventTap = nil
        }
    }
    
    private func handleEvent(_ event: CGEvent) -> Unmanaged<CGEvent>? {
        // Event processing happens on background thread
        // Delegate callbacks dispatched to main thread
        
        if matchesCurrentHotkey(event) {
            DispatchQueue.main.async { [weak self] in
                self?.delegate?.didStartRecording()
            }
        }
        
        return nil
    }
}
```
