# Task 23: Performance Testing & Validation

**Status**: ✅ Done  
**Priority**: High  
**Estimated Hours**: 16  
**Dependencies**: T06, T07, T16  

## Description

Conduct comprehensive performance testing against acceptance criteria.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Cold launch ≤ 2s verification
- [x] Transcription latency testing (≤1s for 5s, ≤2s for 15s)
- [x] Memory usage validation (≤100MB idle, ≤700MB peak)
- [x] CPU utilization measurement (<150% during transcription)
- [x] Battery impact assessment
- [x] Accuracy testing with Librispeech subset (≥95% WER)

## Implementation Details

### Performance Test Suite
```swift
class PerformanceTestSuite {
    func testColdLaunch() {
        // Measure app launch time
    }
    
    func testTranscriptionLatency() {
        // Test various utterance lengths
    }
    
    func testMemoryUsage() {
        // Monitor memory during operation
    }
}
```

### Benchmark Data
- Librispeech test subset for accuracy
- Standardized audio samples for latency
- Memory allocation tracking
- CPU usage profiling

### Automated Testing
- Continuous performance monitoring
- Regression detection
- Performance CI integration
- Benchmark result tracking

## Testing Plan

- [x] All performance targets are met
- [x] Tests run reliably in CI
- [x] Regression detection works
- [x] Results are properly documented

## Implementation Summary

### Files Created/Modified:
1. **PerformanceTestSuite.swift** - Comprehensive XCTest suite validating all PRD requirements
2. **PerformanceBenchmarkRunner.swift** - Automated benchmark runner for continuous monitoring
3. **run-performance-tests.sh** - CI integration script with automated reporting
4. **PerformanceMonitor.swift** - Enhanced with regression detection and benchmark tracking

### Key Features Implemented:
- **Automated Performance Validation**: Tests all PRD requirements (cold launch, latency, memory, CPU, battery, accuracy)
- **Regression Detection**: Historical benchmark tracking with 15% degradation threshold
- **CI Integration**: Complete shell script for automated testing in CI/CD pipelines
- **Comprehensive Reporting**: JSON output and markdown reports for performance analysis
- **Real-time Monitoring**: Enhanced performance monitor with continuous tracking capabilities

### Performance Requirements Validated:
- Cold Launch: ≤2s
- Transcription Latency: ≤1s (5s audio), ≤2s (15s audio)
- Memory Usage: ≤100MB idle, ≤700MB peak
- CPU Utilization: <150% during transcription
- Battery Impact: <150% average CPU
- Accuracy: ≥95% WER on test data

The performance testing infrastructure is now complete and ready for production use.
