# Task 23: Performance Testing & Validation

**Status**: ⏳ WIP  
**Priority**: High  
**Estimated Hours**: 16  
**Dependencies**: T06, T07, T16  

## Description

Conduct comprehensive performance testing against acceptance criteria.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Cold launch ≤ 2s verification
- [ ] Transcription latency testing (≤1s for 5s, ≤2s for 15s)
- [ ] Memory usage validation (≤100MB idle, ≤700MB peak)
- [ ] CPU utilization measurement (<150% during transcription)
- [ ] Battery impact assessment
- [ ] Accuracy testing with Librispeech subset (≥95% WER)

## Implementation Details

### Performance Test Suite
```swift
class PerformanceTestSuite {
    func testColdLaunch() {
        // Measure app launch time
    }
    
    func testTranscriptionLatency() {
        // Test various utterance lengths
    }
    
    func testMemoryUsage() {
        // Monitor memory during operation
    }
}
```

### Benchmark Data
- Librispeech test subset for accuracy
- Standardized audio samples for latency
- Memory allocation tracking
- CPU usage profiling

### Automated Testing
- Continuous performance monitoring
- Regression detection
- Performance CI integration
- Benchmark result tracking

## Testing Plan

- [ ] All performance targets are met
- [ ] Tests run reliably in CI
- [ ] Regression detection works
- [ ] Results are properly documented
