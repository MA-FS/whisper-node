## Security Audit Implementation Details

### Network Connection Audit
- **Static Analysis**: Scans binary for network-related symbols
- **Runtime Monitoring**: Uses `lsof` and `dtrace` to detect live connections
- **Zero Network Policy**: Verifies no outbound connections during operation

### Data Storage Privacy Verification
- **Audio File Scanning**: Checks all app directories for persistent audio files
- **Temporary File Management**: Monitors temp file creation and cleanup
- **Data Persistence Audit**: Ensures no user data stored beyond session

### Microphone Permission Handling
- **Entitlements Verification**: Confirms proper microphone permission declaration
- **Permission Boundary Testing**: Validates app respects system permission limits
- **Transparency Compliance**: Ensures clear permission usage disclosure

### Model Download Security
- **HTTPS Enforcement**: Verifies all downloads use secure connections
- **SHA256 Verification**: Confirms cryptographic integrity checking
- **Signature Validation**: Ensures model authenticity verification

### Code Integrity & Signing
- **Digital Signature**: Verifies proper code signing implementation
- **Notarization Status**: Confirms Apple notarization compliance
- **Binary Integrity**: Validates no tampering or modification

### Privacy Policy Alignment
- **Claims Verification**: Maps technical implementation to privacy claims
- **Compliance Checklist**: Provides verification matrix for all privacy assertions
- **Documentation Accuracy**: Ensures policy reflects actual app behavior

## Testing Methodology

### Automated Tests
1. **Binary Analysis**: Static examination of compiled application
2. **Permission Audit**: Entitlements and capability verification
3. **Code Signature**: Digital signature validation
4. **File System Scan**: Data persistence verification

### Manual Tests Required
1. **Runtime Network Monitor**: Monitor live network activity during app operation
2. **Temp File Lifecycle**: Test audio capture, processing, and cleanup
3. **Feature Exercise**: Test all app functionality under monitoring
4. **VirusTotal Scan**: Third-party malware detection verification

### Verification Scripts
- `scripts/security-audit.sh`: Main automated audit runner
- `scripts/runtime-network-monitor.sh`: Live network monitoring
- `scripts/temp-file-audit.sh`: File cleanup verification
- `scripts/virustotal-prep.sh`: Malware scan preparation

## Compliance Framework

### Privacy Regulations
- **GDPR Compliance**: No personal data collection or processing
- **CCPA Compliance**: No data sale or sharing mechanisms
- **Apple Privacy Guidelines**: Transparent permission usage

### Security Standards
- **Code Signing**: Apple Developer Program requirements
- **Sandboxing**: macOS security model compliance
- **Permission Minimization**: Least privilege access principle

### Industry Best Practices
- **Zero Trust Network**: No network access requirements
- **Local Processing**: All computation on-device
- **Data Minimization**: No unnecessary data retention

## Risk Assessment

### Low Risk
- ✅ Network isolation complete
- ✅ Data persistence eliminated
- ✅ Permission scope minimal
- ✅ Code integrity verified

### Monitored Areas
