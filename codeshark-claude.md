# WhisperNode - Security, Performance & Best Practices

## Project Context
macOS voice dictation utility (Swift + Rust) - blazingly fast, privacy-first speech-to-text with press-and-hold activation for developers and power users.

## üîí Security & Privacy Essentials

### Audio Privacy
- Never store or transmit audio data - process entirely on-device
- Clear audio buffers immediately after transcription
- No cloud services, telemetry, or data collection
- Implement secure audio buffer management with proper cleanup

### System Permissions
- Request minimal required permissions (microphone, accessibility)
- Validate accessibility permission before CGEventTap operations
- Handle permission denials gracefully with clear user guidance
- Never escalate privileges beyond what's documented

### Hotkey Security
- Validate CGEventTap events to prevent injection attacks
- Implement proper event filtering for security
- Sanitize text before insertion via CGEventCreateKeyboardEvent
- Rate limit text insertion to prevent system abuse

## ‚ö° Performance Optimization

### Real-Time Transcription
- Target ‚â§1s latency for 5s utterances, ‚â§2s for 15s
- Optimize whisper.cpp model loading and inference
- Implement efficient circular audio buffer (16kHz mono)
- Use Apple Silicon optimizations for ML inference

### Memory Management
- Keep idle memory ‚â§100MB, peak ‚â§700MB with small.en model
- Implement proper model cleanup when switching
- Monitor Core Audio buffer allocations
- Use ARC efficiently in Swift audio processing

### Battery & CPU Optimization
- Maintain <150% CPU utilization during active transcription
- Implement smart power management for background operation
- Optimize Rust FFI calls to minimize overhead
- Profile energy usage with Instruments

## üíª Code Best Practices

### Swift Standards
- Follow Apple's Swift API Design Guidelines
- Use proper error handling with Result types
- Implement comprehensive logging with os_log
- Avoid force unwrapping - use guard/if let patterns

### Rust FFI Integration
- Use proper memory management across Swift-Rust boundary
- Implement thread-safe audio processing
- Handle FFI errors gracefully with proper Swift error translation
- Profile Rust code for memory leaks and performance

### Audio Processing Architecture
- Separate concerns: capture, processing, transcription, insertion
- Use actors for thread-safe audio state management
- Implement proper Core Audio callback handling
- Follow single responsibility principle for audio components

## üö® Critical System Integration Issues

### Accessibility Permissions (CRITICAL)
- Detect and handle accessibility permission denial gracefully
- Provide clear instructions for enabling CGEventTap access
- Test permission flow on clean macOS installations
- Implement fallback modes when permissions unavailable

### Audio System Integration
- Handle Core Audio interruptions and device changes
- Implement proper microphone permission handling
- Test with various audio devices and sample rates
- Recover gracefully from audio system errors

### Text Insertion Reliability
- Ensure text insertion works across all major macOS apps

## üîß Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests
- Test audio processing pipeline with synthetic data
- Validate Rust FFI bindings and memory management
- Test text insertion with various character encodings
- Test error handling for system permission failures

### Integration Tests
- Test complete dictation flow: hotkey ‚Üí audio ‚Üí transcription ‚Üí insertion
- Validate model switching and memory cleanup
- Test across major macOS applications (VS Code, Slack, Safari)
- Test with various Whisper models and audio qualities

### Performance Testing
- Use Instruments for CPU, memory, and energy profiling
- Test transcription accuracy with LibriSpeech dataset
- Validate real-time performance under system load
- Test on various Apple Silicon configurations (M1, M2, M3)

## üì± Accessibility & UX

### VoiceOver Support
- Ensure all UI elements have proper accessibility labels
- Test preferences window with VoiceOver navigation
- Provide audio feedback for transcription states
- Support keyboard-only navigation

### Visual Feedback
- Implement clear visual states for dictation orb (idle, listening, processing)
- Use system colors for proper dark/light mode support
- Ensure sufficient contrast for status indicators
- Provide clear error messaging with actionable solutions
